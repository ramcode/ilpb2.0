In this optical combination CARS modality enables selective visualization of chemical bonds and is used for selective label-free imaging of native cellular proteins and lipids. The SHG/SFG are the excellent modalities for visualization of collagen fibrils in the tissue, extracellular matrix and cellular membranes. Finally, TPEF bridges these types of label-free imaging of cellular macromolecules together with fluorescence detection of specific probes in the samples.Multimodal Nonlinear imaging can be considered as one of the most powerful non-invasive tools for biomolecular mapping in the live cells and tissues. We use it studying changes in biomolecular composition of live cells during cell cycle, apoptosis process and in the course of drug treatment.</p>

                            <p align="justify"> We are also developing new methods of monitoring the intracellular distribution of nanoparticles with high non-linearity based on SHG and SFG for further application of converted light in therapeutic applications.Natural intracellular molecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, lipids and even water, which demonstrate optical non-linear properties, can also be successfully employed for optical upconversion and then trigger photoactivation of different processes. We utilized thisphenomenon for novel nonlinear Photodynamic therapy (PDT) concept. A major limitation of traditional PDT is insufficient penetration of visible (used for PDT drug excitation)light through the tissue, which makes treatment of large or distant tumors not effective. At the same time near-infrared (NIR) light can easily penetrate into the tissue and being up-converted in-situ by natural cellular biomolecules in visible and UV through the CARS/FWM and SHG/SFG processes, can be successively used for photoactivation of most established PDT drugs.

                            <p align="justify"> CARS imaging of liquid crystals (LC) is another exciting area of application of non-linear imaging technique. Polarized CARS signal of LC is sensitive to orientation of anisotropic molecules in liquid crystals, or director. This property allows us to produce spatial mapping of the director structures, and, therefore to visualize different types of defects in LC. Because of high non-linearity of LC leading to (i) excellent imaging contrast and (ii) short times of signal integration and imaging acquisition (less than 1 s), this technique might allow to study temporal dynamics of the director structures.</p>

                            <p align="justify">While non-linear imaging is excellent for mapping of molecular distributions in 2D and 3D objects, Raman micro-spectrometry is efficient tool for site specific quantitive molecular analysis. In combination with the Biomolecular Analysis (BCA), this technique is the most powerful tool for single cell assay, and can interrogate the molecular content of distinct cellular domains in-situ. Using this tool we are investigating the processes in single live cells such as relaxation of chromatin after mitosis, monitoring the synthesis of rRNA and p in nucleolus and local changes of subcellular molecular environment during both physiologic and pathologic processes. We also study an effect of chemical fixation on biomolecular composition of individual domains of the cell nucleus We are also developing methods for targeting the specific intracellular domains by Raman markers, including Resonant Raman markers, SERS markers and exogenous markers with characteristic spectral bands (e.g. C-D, C=N, C=C) in bio-silent spectral Raman region.</p>

                            <p align="justify">Anti-Stokes luminescence is caused by the optical excitation when absorption of photons with lower energy from thermally populated vibrational-rotational states of the ground electronic state. Since the population of the upper vibrational levels of the ground state is temperature dependent (based on Boltzmann distribution), the ASL intensity is extremely temperature dependent. The anti-Stokes fluorescence technique is particularly suitable for micro- and sub-micro characterization of in-plane thermal transport in thin films and allows for both transient as well as steady-state regimes of characterization. The sub-microscale length regime, falling between sub-continuum and continuum transport physics, is of particular importance, as recent work has shown that material processing to create domain sizes in this regime offers substantial, though highly complex, improvements in thermoelectric performance.</p>

                                Since optical tweezers was introduced by Ashkin in 1970, the ability of this tool to apply pico-Newton-level forces to micron-sized particles while simultaneously measuring displacement with nanometer-level precision is now routinely applied to the study of molecular motors at the single-molecule level, the physics of colloids and mesoscopic systems, and the mechanical properties of polymers and biopolymers. We used this technique for variety studies in the physics of liquid crystals, sol-gel processes and biological objects.
