                                A new, onion-like nanoparticle could open new frontiers in biomaging, solar energy harvesting and light-based security techniques. When it comes to bioimaging, near-infrared light could be used to activate the light-emitting nanoparticles deep inside the body, providing high-contrast images of areas of interest. In the realm of security, nanoparticle-infused inks could be incorporated into currency designs; such ink would be invisible to the naked eye, but glow blue when hit by a low-energy laser pulse — a trait very difficult for counterfeiters to reproduce.

                                Collaborative Roswell Park/UB team uses Raman microspectroscopy to monitor drug action in single-cell assay. Researchers have developed a new approach to characterizing and monitoring changes in cellular structure. The new type of single-cell-based assay, developed by researchers at Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) and the University at Buffalo (UB), may provide a tool for detecting cancerous cells early and monitoring cell-to-cell variations in cancer progression or in response to pharmaceutical drugs.

                            <p align="justify">
                                Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an effective treatment for easily accessible tumors, such as oral and skin cancer.Doctors have used PDT to treat cancer for decades. Cancer cells absorb the drug, which is delivered to the tumor via the bloodstream or locally. Visible light then is applied to the site, which causes the drug to react with oxygen and creates a burst of free radicals that kill the tumor. Unfortunately, visible light does not penetrate tissue well. Conversely, near-infrared light penetrates tissue well but doesn't activate the drugs efficiently. To solve this problem, some researchers are developing drugs that absorb near-infrared light. This method is limited, however, because stable and efficient near-infrared absorbing photosenzitizers are notoriously difficult to synthesize. The UB-led team took a different approach, which uses the tumor's natural environment to tune the light into the necessary wavelengths.

"It was an exciting field with a lot of great potential; at this time, it was very new, and everything needed to be done," Levy remembers, "I moved to UB because of Dr. Prasad, who proposed to me to develop my ideas in his lab. What I found there was a great place with diverse expertise in biology, physics, chemistry and medicine. This environment was quite unique 15 years ago, and clearly helped me in developing those concepts."

The findings, <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/nn4029234">published online July 10 in the journal ACS Nano</a>, suggest that the silicon nanocrystals, known as quantum dots, may be a safe tool for diagnostic imaging in humans. The nanocrystals absorb and emit light in the near-infrared part of the spectrum, a quality that makes them ideal for seeing deeper into tissue than traditional fluorescence-based techniques.

                                According to University at Buffalo researchers,super-small particles of silicon react with water to produce hydrogen almost instantaneously. in a series of experiments, the scientists created spherical silicon particles about 10 nanometers in diameter. When combined with water, these particles reacted to form silicic acid (a nontoxic byproduct) and hydrogen - a potential source of energy for fuel cells.The reaction didn't require any light, heat or electricity, and also created hydrogen about 150 times faster than similar reactions using silicon particles 100 nanometers wide, and 1,000 times faster than bulk silicon, according to the study. The findings appeared online in Nano Letters on Jan. 14. The scientists were able to verify that the hydrogen they made was relatively pure by testing it successfully in a small fuel cell that powered a fan.

                                While conducting postdoctoral research at UB's Institute for Lasers, Photonics and Biophotonics about a decade ago, entrepreneur Laurent Levy co-invented two nanomedicine technologies for treatment and diagnosis of cancer. These two inventions became the first intellectual property that Levy used to found Nanobiotix, a French nanomedicine firm he started in 2003. This October, Nanobiotix was listed on the NYSE Euronext market after raising 14.2 million euros ($18.1 million) in an IPO.

                                An international research team has created unique photoluminescent nanoparticles that shine clearly through more than 3 centimeters of biological tissue -- a depth that makes them a promising tool for deep-tissue optical bioimaging. Though optical imaging is a robust and inexpensive technique commonly used in biomedical applications, current technologies lack the ability to look deep into tissue, the researchers said. This creates a demand for the development of new approaches that provide high-resolution, high-contrast optical bioimaging that doctors and scientists could use to identify tumors or other anomalies deep beneath the skin. The newly created nanoparticles consist of a nanocrystalline core containing thulium, sodium, ytterbium and fluorine, all encased inside a square, calcium-fluoride shell.

                                Researchers at the Keck School of Medicine and the State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo have developed a method that increases the effectiveness of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer treatment in mouse models by more than 50 percent. The study, "Gold nanorod-sphingosine kinase siRNA nanocomplexes: a novel therapeutic tool for potent radiosensitization of head and neck cancer," was led by first author Rizwan Masood, assistant professor of research in otolaryngology, and conducted in the laboratory of Uttam Sinha, associate professor of otolaryngology at the Keck School. The research was published in the journal Integrative Biology.

                                BUFFALO, N.Y. -- In the images of fruit flies, clusters of neurons are all lit up, forming a brightly glowing network of highways within the brain. It's exactly what University at Buffalo researcher Shermali Gunawardena was hoping to see: It meant that ORMOSIL, a novel class of nanoparticles, had successfully penetrated the insects' brains. And even after long-term exposure, the cells and the flies themselves remained unharmed.
